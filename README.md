## About studyspot ðŸ“š

studySpot is a student/university oriented social media website created by students! The goal of studySpot is to offer students a way to connect with their fellow classmates without the clutter of other social media sites. Think of a subreddit or a Discord community but intended purely for university students and focuses on using sticky notes.
